# DEPA Inferencing

This repository contains an implementation of DEPA Inferencing Framework that enables privacy-preserving, real-time data sharing between organizations.

DEPA Inferencing supports a broad class data sharing scenarios where a service provider (Data Provider) wishes to share sensitive data about a specific customer (Data Principal) with a partner (Data Consumer). Current privacy laws such as the DPDP Act require that data sharing respect the data principal's right to privacy e.g., using a consent manager to obtain explicit, fine-grained, timely, and revocable consent from the data principal. In scenarios where fine-grained consent is not feasible, DEPA Inferencing enables data sharing through the use of privacy-preserving technologies.
